This is intended to be a complete interface to the DALI protocol as
defined in Annex E of IEC-60929 and (if I can get my hands on them!)
the various parts of IEC-62386.

At the moment the example code works with "daliserver" from
https://github.com/onitake/daliserver but ought to be easy to adapt to
work with other DALI interfaces.
